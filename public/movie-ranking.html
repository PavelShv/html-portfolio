<h3>Die Hard</h3>
<p>New York City policeman John McClane (Bruce Willis) is visiting his estranged wife (Bonnie Bedelia) and two daughters on
Christmas Eve. He joins her at a holiday party in the headquarters of the Japanese-owned business she works for. But the
festivities are interrupted by a group of terrorists who take over the exclusive high-rise, and everyone in it. Very
soon McClane realizes that there's no one to save the hostages - but him.</p>
<h3>Game of Thrones</h3>
<p>George R.R. Martin's best-selling book series "A Song of Ice and Fire" is brought to the screen as HBO sinks its
considerable storytelling teeth into the medieval fantasy epic. It's the depiction of two powerful families -- kings and
queens, knights and renegades, liars and honest men -- playing a deadly game for control of the Seven Kingdoms of
Westeros, and to sit atop the Iron Throne.</p>
<h3>Mad Max</h3>
<p>In a not-too-distant dystopian future, when man's most precious resource -- oil -- has been depleted and the world
plunged into war, famine and financial chaos, the last vestiges of the law in Australia attempt to restrain a vicious
biker gang. Max (Mel Gibson), an officer with the Main Force Patrol, launches a personal vendetta against the gang when
his wife (Joanne Samuel) and son are hunted down and murdered, leaving him with nothing but the instincts for survival
and retribution.</p>
